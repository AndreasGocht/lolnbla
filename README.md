=======

lolnbla (lol never be late again) is a small php project to inform your lol friends when you will come online.

== HOW TO

First you need an lol account.

If you have one, you want to use for sending the messages, you have to add all summenors you want to send messages as friends.

Next edit the config.php, and the .htusers.
The .htusers file manage the access to your site, via .htaccess (de.selfhtml.org/servercgi/server/htaccess.htm) the test user is test with the password test.

At least add all summenors you want so send messages via these program. Use the interface provided via the index.php.
You have to notice the summenors in the style:
name1;sum123456@pvp.net
name2;sum234455@pvp.net

etc.
Each summenor has its own number. To get the numbers you may use lolking.

Now your able to send messages to your friends with the content "User XYZ ist in 15 min online".
At the moment it's only German, maybe English translation will follow the next days ;-)

Have fun.
